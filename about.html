        <h1>About Us</h1>

         <p>Welcome to our first website! This quiz is a collaboration between Annabelle Batchelor and Natalie Morrison, 
             as part of our Code First: Professionals - Introduction to Web Development. When we got together as a team, 
             it was easy to see where we wanted to take our project; we both wanted to showcase our skills and we're both 
             from beautiful countries, so we decided to combine our newly acquired passion for web development and create 
             a quiz about our countries. We both hope you have fun in our first website, we would love to expand our quiz 
             and make it global. How amazing it would be for the user to select which countries they'd like to play with 
             and in turn learn more about other nations and cultures!?</p>

         <br>

         <p>If you'd like more information about our countries of origin, check out these links 
             to learn more about

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela" target="_blank">Venezuela</a>.</p>
